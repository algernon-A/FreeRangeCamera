  <LongDescription>## Free Range Camera
- **Freely move the camera outside the playable area** - limited to twice the full background map maximum distance (8x the playable area width) so you don't get totally lost.
- **Increased maximum zoom-out range** - easily see the whole map at once.
- Works both **in-game** and **in the editor**.

## Instructions
None needed - simply install the mod!  The camera bounds should be freed up automatically.
