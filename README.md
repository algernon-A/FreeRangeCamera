## Free Ramge Camera
A mod for Cities: Skylines 2.  Available for download only on [Paradox Mods](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/75749/Windows).

The primary platform for support is the [Cities Skylines Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/HTav7ARPs2).

### Key features
- **Freely move the camera outside the playable area** - limited to twice the full background map maximum distance (8x the playable area width) so you don't get totally lost.
- **Increased maximum zoom-out range** - easily see the whole map at once.
- Works both **in-game** and **in the editor**.

### Instructions
None needed - simply install the mod!  The camera bounds should be freed up automatically.

### Modders
Modders (and aspiring modders!), as always I'm available and happy to chat about what I've done and answer any questions, and also about how you can implement anything that I've done for your own mods.  Come grab me on the [Cities Skylines Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/HTav7ARPs2)!
